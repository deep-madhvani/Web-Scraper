# ▶ Getting Started

1) Clone this repository
2) Install [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) if you don't already have it: `npm install -g nodemon`
3) `cd` into the 'server' folder
4) Run `npm install`
5) ‼ **IMPORTANT** ‼ You need to create a `.env` file inside of the `server` folder. Make a copy of the provided `env.sample` file and rename it to `.env`.
Most of the configuration is set for you but you do need to provide your own Bright Data API key, collector ID, and MongoDB connection string.
6) After setting up your configuration, start the project by running `nodemon`
